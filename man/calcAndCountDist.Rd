\title{Count frequency of differences between values in integer vectors.}
\usage{
calcAndCountDist(query, reference, cnt)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{first \code{integer} vector.}

\item{reference}{second \code{integer} vector. Distances are calculated from
each element in \code{query} to each greater element in
\code{reference}.}

\item{cnt}{\code{NumericVector} to store the result in. The length of
\code{cnt} defines the maximal distance that will be included in the
analysis, and new counts will be added to the values of \code{cnt}
(repeated calls to \code{calcAndCountDist} will increment existing
counts).}
}
\value{
\code{numeric} vector \code{cnt}, where \code{cnt[d]} correspond to
the number of observed distances \code{d}.
}
\description{
Given two ascendingly sorted integer vectors \code{query} and
\code{reference}, calculate and count the differences between their
elements that are greater than zero and less than \code{maxd}. The
number of observed distances \code{d} are reported in \code{cnt[d]},
and \code{maxd} corresponds to the \code{length(cnt)}. The function is
called by \code{\link{calcModbaseSpacing}}, which provides a higher level,
more convenient interface.
