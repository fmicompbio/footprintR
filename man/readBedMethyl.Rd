\title{Read collapsed single-molecule footprinting data from a \code{bedMethyl} file.}
\usage{
readBedMethyl(
  fnames,
  modbase = NULL,
  nrows = Inf,
  seqlens = NULL,
  sequence.context = 0,
  sequence.reference = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fnames}{Character vector with one or several paths of \code{bedMethyl}
files, such as generated by \code{modkit pileup}. Each file will be read
separately and become one of the columns in the returned
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object.
If \code{fnames} is a named vector, the names are used as column names in
the returned object. Otherwise, the column names will be \code{s1}, ...,
\code{sN}, where \code{N} is the length of \code{fnames}.
If several elements of \code{fnames} have identical
names, the data from the corresponding files are summed into a single
column in the returned object.}

\item{modbase}{Character vector defining the modified base (or bases) to
read. Useful for reading a subset of the data from \code{bedMethyl} files
that contain multiple types of modified bases. If \code{NULL} (the
default), all rows in the input file are read.}

\item{nrows}{Only read \code{nrows} rows of the input file.}

\item{seqlens}{\code{NULL} or a named vector of sequence lengths for genomic
sequences (chromosomes). Useful to set the sorting order of sequence names.}

\item{sequence.context}{A numeric scalar giving the size of the sequence
context to be extracted from the reference (\code{sequence.reference}
argument). The context will be centered on the modified base. If
\code{sequence.context = 0} (the default), no sequence context will
be extracted.}

\item{sequence.reference}{A character scalar either giving the name of a
\code{BSgenome} package, or the path to a fasta formatted file with
reference sequences. The sequence context (see \code{sequence.context}
argument) will be extracted from these sequences.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, report on progress.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object
with genomic positions in rows and samples (the unique names of
\code{fnames}) in the columns.
}
\description{
This function will read collapsed single-molecule footprinting data
(reads combined per genomic position) from a \code{bedMethyl} file.
}
\examples{
bmfile <- system.file("extdata", "modkit_pileup_1.bed.gz", package = "footprintR")
