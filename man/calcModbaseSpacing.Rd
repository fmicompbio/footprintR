\title{Calculate distances between modified bases on individual reads.}
\usage{
calcModbaseSpacing(
  se,
  assay.type = "mod_prob",
  min_mod_prob = 0.5,
  rmdup = TRUE,
  dmax = 1000L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object
with read-level footprinting data, for example returned by
\code{\link{readModBam}}. Rows should correspond to positions
and columns to samples.}

\item{assay.type}{A string or integer scalar specifying the assay of
\code{se} containing the read-level modification probabilities.}

\item{min_mod_prob}{Numeric scalar giving the minimal modification
probability for a modified base.}

\item{rmdup}{Logical scalar indicating if duplicates should be removed.
If \code{TRUE} (the default), only one of several alignments starting at
the same coordinate is used.}

\item{dmax}{Numeric scalar specifying the maximal distance between
modified bases on the same read to count.}
}
\value{
\code{integer} vector with \code{dmax} elements, with the element at
position \code{d} giving the observed number of alignment pairs at that
distance.
}
\description{
Calculate the frequencies of same read modified base distances,
for example from read-level modification data to estimate nucleosome
repeat length. Distance calculations are implemented in C++
(\code{\link{calcAndCountDist}}) for efficiency.

\examples{
modbamfiles <- system.file("extdata",
                           c("6mA_1_10reads.bam", "6mA_2_10reads.bam"),
                           package = "footprintR")
se <- readModBam(modbamfiles, "chr1:6940000-6955000", "a")

moddist <- calcModbaseSpacing(se)
print(estimateNRL(moddist)[1:2])
plotModbaseSpacing(moddist)
plotModbaseSpacing(moddist, detailedPlots = TRUE)

Phasograms were originally described in Valouev et al., Nature
2011 (doi:10.1038/nature10002). The implementation here differs in three
ways from the original algorithms:
\enumerate{
\item Instead of same strand alignment start positions, this function
is adapted to single-molecule footprinting data and measures
the distances between same-read modified base positions.
\item It does not implement removing of positions that have been seen
less than \code{n} times (referred to as a \code{n}-pile subset in
the paper).
\item It does allow to retain only alignments that fall into selected
genomic intervals (\code{regions} argument).

\code{\link{estimateNRL}} to estimate the nucleosome repeat length
from a phasogram, \code{\link{plotModbaseSpacing}} to visualize an annotated
phasogram, \code{\link{calcAndCountDist}} for low-level distance counting.
